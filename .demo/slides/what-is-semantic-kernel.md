# Semantic Kernel

Semantic Kernel is an open-source SDK developed by Microsoft to help developers integrate AI capabilities—especially large language models (LLMs)—into their applications in a modular and extensible way. It provides a framework for combining natural language processing with traditional programming logic, enabling the orchestration of AI "skills" (functions) and "memories" (contextual data) to build intelligent agents and copilots. 

Originally introduced in early 2023 as part of Microsoft's broader AI strategy, Semantic Kernel was designed to bridge the gap between LLMs and conventional software development by offering tools for prompt engineering, planning, and memory management. It supports multiple programming languages, including C# and Python, and has evolved rapidly with community contributions and enterprise use cases, especially in building AI-powered workflows and assistants.

Semantic Kernel can be used to:

- Run AI-powered functions like summarization or translation.
- Plan and execute tasks using AI to break down goals into steps.
- Manage prompts for consistent and reusable AI interactions.
- Integrate with different AI models like OpenAI or Azure OpenAI.

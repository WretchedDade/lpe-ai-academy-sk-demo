# What are agents

An agent is an autonomous or semi-autonomous system that perceives its environment, makes decisions, and takes actions to achieve specific goals. These agents can range from simple rule-based bots to complex systems powered by machine learning and large language models. Key characteristics of AI agents include:

- **Perception**: They gather data from their environment (e.g., sensors, user input, APIs).
- **Reasoning**: They process information to make decisions, often using logic, heuristics, or AI models.
- **Action**: They perform tasks or communicate results, either physically (robots) or digitally (software agents).
- **Learning**: Many agents can improve over time by learning from data or feedback.

Examples include virtual assistants (like Siri or Alexa), recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, and AI copilots in software development or customer service.

In the context of Semantic Kernel, an agent is a software entity that uses AI models (like large language models) along with memory, skills, and planning capabilities to autonomously perform tasks or assist users. These agents can be used to power intelligent assistants, automate workflows, or interact with users in a conversational way.

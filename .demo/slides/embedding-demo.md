# Basic Embedding Demo

In this demo, we use Semantic Kernel to generate embeddings for a "source material" sentence and then two queries. We then calculate the similarity of the queries to the sentence to show how the value can differ based on how similar the LLM thinks the semantic meaning of the queries are to the source material.

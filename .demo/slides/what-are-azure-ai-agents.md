# What are Azure AI Agents

Azure AI Agents, part of the Azure AI Foundry Agent Service, are fully managed, extensible AI-powered software entities designed to autonomously perform tasks, assist users, or integrate into workflows. These agents combine powerful language models (like GPT-4o, Llama, or Mistral) with tools, memory, and logic to reason, act, and interact in complex environments.

Key features include:

- **Prebuilt and custom agents**: Developers can use templates or build agents from scratch.
- **Connected agents**: Multiple agents can collaborate, enabling multi-agent systems.
- **Tool integration**: Agents can use tools like Bing Search, Morningstar data, or Microsoft Fabric.
- **Event-driven triggers**: Agents can be invoked automatically via Azure Logic Apps.
- **Monitoring and debugging**: Built-in tracing and Azure Monitor support help track agent behavior and performance.

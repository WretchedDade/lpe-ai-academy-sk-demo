# What are tools

Tools are definitions that are given to LLMs and outline the inputs, outputs, and purpose of the tool. When tool calling is enabled, the LLM can decide to invoke, one, none, or multiple tools based on what it thinks is necessary to properly respond to the ask from the user. Tools can be used for retrieving data or taking actions (like creating data).
